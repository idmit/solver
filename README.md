Solver
======

###Description
Solver provides a convinient way to create and edit SLAE problems.
It can support any solution method, even those which depend on parameters (for example precision).

###Future
Theoretically solver can be extended with other problem types (for example ODE). For now only SLAE type and QR decomposition method are implemented.
